Linux kernel is awesome. So why linux has struggled to replace Microsoft's Windows?


In this article I will give multiple reasons why I think linux, in it's current form, won't replace Windows in the near future.\
I will also give examples and features I want to see in an ideal linux distro. I have given deep though and learned from tutorials how to create my own custom\
linux distro. This article will form the basis of my research and experience and maybe in the future I will implement my own linux distro.

# [](#header-1)Linux is not intuitive


Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, all of the major distributions have GUI. But they lack intuitive feedback from the user. 

## [](#header-2)gnome-nautilus

Ubuntu's File Explorer (gnome-nautilius) is basic file explorer and not intuitive.

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ or `keyword`.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

```js

end

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
