Linux kernel is awesome. So why linux has struggled to replace Microsoft's Windows?


In this article I will give multiple reasons why I think linux, in it's current form, won't replace Windows in the near future.\
I will also give examples and features I want to see in an ideal linux distro. I have given deep though and learned from tutorials how to create my own custom\
linux distro. This article will form the basis of my research and experience and maybe in the future I will implement my own linux distro.

# [](#header-1)Linux is not productive


Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, all of the major distributions have GUI. But they lack intuitive feedback from the user and their productive nature is lacking at best. Major changes need to happen to each core GUI package.


Major applications users interact with are:

* File explorer
* Taskbar (toolbar / dock)
* Start / Search (Windows key)
* Settings
* Desktop[ customization (too much, too little)
* Printers
* Third-party applications (screen recorder, torrenting, email...)

<!-- 
Return to desktop button (in Windows taskbar right-most)
-->
I will also touch:


* Driver installation
* Shortcuts
* Standardization on linux

Ubuntu's File Explorer (gnome-nautilius) is basic file explorer and not intuitive.
